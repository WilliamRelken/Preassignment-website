a config folder needs to be made and in it this export,

module.exports = {
    mongoURI: 'MongoDB application URI',
    cookieKey: 'Your cookie key'
}

Run npm install in both the client directory and the main directory.

If any dependecy errors occur npm install mongoose and npm install nodemon must be run.
